üß† Integrated Credit Risk Modeling and Loan Optimization with Advanced Segmentation
Author: NipunVar
üìò Overview

This project focuses on leveraging advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques to develop a comprehensive credit risk assessment, credit scoring, and loan optimization framework.

The system uses transactional data from an E-commerce platform to classify users into high-risk and low-risk segments, enabling a data-driven Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) credit service.

The goal is to identify predictors of default, engineer relevant features, and build predictive models to estimate risk probabilities, credit scores, and optimal loan recommendations.

This end-to-end solution empowers financial institutions and E-commerce partners to make informed lending decisions while effectively managing risk.

üéØ Project Objectives
1. Customer Segmentation

Goal: Perform advanced customer segmentation using RFMS (Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value, and Standard Deviation of Amount Spent).

Outcome: Classify customers into high-risk and low-risk groups to tailor BNPL offerings accordingly.

2. Credit Risk Modeling

Goal: Build machine learning models to estimate credit risk and default probabilities.

Outcome: Generate customer-level risk probabilities to support data-driven credit approvals.

Credit Score Model: Compute credit scores derived from risk probabilities, aligned with FICO-like scoring standards.

3. Loan Optimization Model

Goal: Optimize loan amounts, repayment periods, and other terms using predictive modeling and optimization techniques.

Outcome: Deliver personalized loan offers to customers, enhancing the BNPL service‚Äôs profitability and user satisfaction.

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

The project integrates supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, including:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical)

Models are trained and validated using historical BNPL datasets and external credit bureau data.

The final models are designed for deployment within a BNPL decision engine to enhance credit evaluation, customer satisfaction, and business performance.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection and Preprocessing

Collect and preprocess historical BNPL application and repayment data.

Tasks include:

Handling missing values

Normalization and standardization

Encoding categorical variables

Merging external credit bureau data

2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Perform an in-depth exploratory analysis to uncover customer behavior patterns and correlations influencing default risk.

Key analyses:

Distribution of loan defaults across customer segments

Spending and repayment trends

Outlier and anomaly detection

3Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering

Enhance model performance through feature construction, including the RFMS framework:

Recency: Days since last transaction

Frequency: Number of transactions

Monetary Value: Average spend amount

Standard Deviation: Volatility of spending

Segmentation Visualization:
Visualize customers in RFMS space and draw decision boundaries for high vs low risk groups.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Weight of Evidence (WoE) Binning

Transform continuous variables using Weight of Evidence (WoE) binning to strengthen the predictive capacity of logistic models.

This step ensures monotonic relationships between variables and target outcomes.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Selection

Identify and retain the most predictive variables through:

Correlation Analysis

Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)

Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)

Output:
Final list of selected features used for modeling.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Development

Develop multiple models targeting different aspects of credit evaluation and optimization:

üß© Model 1: Gradient Boosting Classifier

Purpose: Predict credit risk and estimate default probability.

üß© Model 2: Linear Regression

Purpose: Generate credit scores from predicted risk probabilities.

üß© Model 3: Loan Optimization

Purpose: Recommend optimal loan amount and repayment period using regression and constraint-based optimization.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation and Selection

Evaluate model performance using metrics such as:

AUC-ROC

Gini Coefficient

Precision / Recall / F1-score

KS Statistic

Select the best-performing model based on validation results and business interpretability.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Model Deployment and Integration

Integrate the chosen models into the BNPL platform pipeline to automate:

Real-time credit scoring

Loan recommendation

Risk-based decision-making

Deployment can be achieved using Flask / FastAPI for serving predictions or Power BI dashboards for interactive reporting.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring and Continuous Improvement

Regularly track model performance post-deployment:

Monitor drift in data and model accuracy

Retrain using recent data

Evaluate KPIs such as default rate, approval rate, and profit margin
